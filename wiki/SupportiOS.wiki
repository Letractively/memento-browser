= FAQ =
==1. What is a Memento?==
_A Memento is an archived version of a web page at a particular date._

==2. Why isn't there a page for every day?==
_The internet is far to extensive for web archivers to store everyday._

==3. Why can't I always push the Now button?==
_If the web page you are viewing is the current version of the page the Now button will be disabled._

==4. Why do the pages look different sometimes?==
_There are several different archives that store Mementos and each on has a slightly different way of building their pages._

==5. Why don't all the pictures load on a page I am viewing?==
_When a page gets archived sometimes an element from the page (such as a picture) isn't archived properly._
